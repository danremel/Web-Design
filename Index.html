	<p>I am an easy-going quick learner who enjoys providing positive customer experiences in everything I do. Through my experience in music, sales, and event service I have learned how to effectively interact with people from all walks of life and make them feel welcome.<br><br>

With a professional attitude and a positive outlook I believe that I can be an asset to any team I work with. When working in teams I have the skills, confidence, and cooperative mindset to take the lead and assign each teammate to their strengths and operate at the team's best efficiency.<br><br>

I have experience in collaboration, marketing, social media, public relations, sales, promotion, and team leadership. I also enjoy learning about coding, web design and electronics in my spare time.</p>
